# Builder.io App Router Template

A [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) monorepo template pairing **Next.js 16 (App Router)** with the **Builder.io Gen 2 SDK** (`@builder.io/sdk-react`) for visual editing. It ships a shared component library, a shared design-token theme, and a Storybook workspace.

This is the App Router port of the Pages Router `builder-app-template`. It is functionally equivalent, rebuilt on React Server Components, the Gen 2 Builder SDK, and Next.js 16's `proxy.ts` (the replacement for `middleware.ts`).

## Tech Stack

- **Turborepo** + **pnpm workspaces** (`pnpm@9.15.4`)
- **Next.js 16** App Router with **React 19**
- **Builder.io Gen 2 SDK** (`@builder.io/sdk-react`)
- **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Storybook 9** (`@storybook/nextjs-vite`)

## Getting Started

Install dependencies (use **pnpm**):

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Guided setup (recommended)

Run the interactive setup from the repo root:

```bash
pnpm configure
```

> Use `pnpm configure`, not `pnpm setup` — `pnpm setup` is a reserved pnpm built-in that configures the shell environment.

It will:

1. Prompt for your Builder.io **public** and **private** API keys and write them into the app's `.env.local`.
2. Optionally **rename** the placeholder `gacore` app (updates every reference across the monorepo and moves the directory — re-run `pnpm install` afterward).
3. Provision the Builder space by running `init:builder` (see below).

### Provision Builder.io models

`pnpm configure` does this for you; run it directly when you only need to (re)seed models.

The app reads models that don't exist in a brand-new Builder space:

- **`site-context`** — global site data (name, logo, organization/contact details, social links) read by every page in the root layout.
- **`article`** — the blog content model behind `/blogs/[handle]` and the sitemap.
- **`url-redirect`** — a list of redirect rules applied at build time (see [URL redirects](#url-redirects)).

Without them the app throws `"Error fetching data."` at runtime and `pnpm build` fails with `"Model not found"`. A one-time seed script creates the models and populates a default `site-context` entry, a sample article, plus a sample redirect:

```bash
# Requires BUILDER_PRIVATE_KEY in apps/gacore/.env.local (bpk-...)
pnpm --filter gacore init:builder
```

The script ([`apps/gacore/scripts/seed-builder.mjs`](./apps/gacore/scripts/seed-builder.mjs)) is **idempotent** — re-running it skips anything that already exists, so it's safe to run on every fresh clone. Edit the seeded defaults afterward in the Builder.io editor.

> The model schemas are created through the Builder **Admin GraphQL API** (`addModel`); the default content is written through the **Write REST API** (the Admin GraphQL API has no content-write mutation).

### Run the development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app. Builder.io content is fetched and rendered through the App Router catch-all route in `apps/gacore/app/[[...page]]/`.

## URL redirects

Redirect rules are managed in the Builder.io **`url-redirect`** model — no code change or redeploy-by-hand required to add a rule, just edit content in Builder. Each entry holds a `redirects` list, and every rule has three fields:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `urlFrom` | Source path to match. Supports Next.js path syntax, e.g. `/old/:slug*`. |
| `urlTo` | Destination path or URL, e.g. `/new-page`. |
| `permanentRedirect` | On → **308** (permanent). Off → **307** (temporary). Defaults to permanent. |

[`apps/gacore/lib/redirects.ts`](./apps/gacore/lib/redirects.ts) reads every entry and feeds the rules into Next.js's [`redirects()`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/redirects) in [`next.config.ts`](./apps/gacore/next.config.ts).

This runs at **build time** — redirect changes in Builder take effect on the next deploy. That keeps redirects fast (handled by Next/the CDN with no per-request fetch) and is the right trade-off for most sites. The fetch fails open: a missing model or network error logs a warning and ships zero redirects rather than breaking the build. If a project outgrows Next's ~1,024-redirect limit or needs per-domain rules, graduate to a `proxy.ts`/middleware approach that reads a generated JSON file at request time.

## Common Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm configure` | Guided first-run setup: API keys, optional app rename, Builder provisioning |
| `pnpm dev` | Start the development server (port 3000) |
| `pnpm --filter gacore init:builder` | Provision the `site-context`, `article`, and `url-redirect` models in a fresh Builder space |
| `pnpm build` | Build all apps except Storybook |
| `pnpm build-all` | Build everything, including Storybook |
| `pnpm lint` | Lint the workspace |
| `pnpm storybook` | Start Storybook at http://localhost:6006 |
| `pnpm build-storybook` | Build the static Storybook site |

## Claude Code commands

This template ships a suite of Claude Code slash commands under
`.claude/commands/` (PR creation, PR feedback, Jira grooming and dev pipeline,
solution review, build fixes, and component scaffolding). They read per-project
values — Jira project key, cloud ID, base URL, and Vercel project name — from
`.claude/project-config.md`, which `pnpm configure` populates. If you skip Jira
during setup, the Jira-aware commands simply omit their Jira steps.

Notably, **`/new-component`** scaffolds a new component following the
self-contained-folder pattern in
[`packages/components/COMPONENT_PATTERN.md`](./packages/components/COMPONENT_PATTERN.md),
and asks whether it should be registered with Builder.io.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy is the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new). Set the project's root to the monorepo root and provide the Builder.io environment variables from `env.example`.
